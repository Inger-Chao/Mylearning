## The Power of Vulnerabilities [建议信/解决自卑烦恼型可用]

I want to share to you my views and tell some stories about a piece of research that fundamentally expanded my perception and actually changed the way that I live and love in my whole life.

It's universal that shame as the fear of connection. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. The things that underpinned this fear was excruciating vulnerability. In order for connection to happen, you have to allow your self to be seen, this is your chance to beat it back with your measuring stick.

When you divided people we can found that who really have a sense of worthiness -- they have strong belonging and love -- are folks who struggle for wondering whether they're good enough.

Personally and professionally, the worthiness to connection are whole-hearted people living from the deep sense of worthiness and they had in common was a sense of courage and bravery to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others. As a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be , in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection. 

The other thing that they had in common was embrace vulnerability. From  the perspective of those brave people, vulnerability is the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees, the willingness to breathe through the tough time.

We live in a vulnerable world and one of the way we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. It's not the only reason that the evidence existed such as obese, in-debt, procrastination... But you can't numb those hard feelings. You'll numb everything if you choose to be numb and then you'll miserable and looking for purpose and meaning to a dangerous circle. The more negative you are, the more vulnerable you are. 

To let yourself be deeply vulnerably seen, to love with your whole heart even though there's no guarantee, to practice gratitude and lean in joy, to be confident and satisfied, then you stop screaming and start listening, you are kinder and gentler to yourself and the people around you. That's the road to build a better place for live.
