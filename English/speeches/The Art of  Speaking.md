[TED: The Art of Speaking](https://gslb.miaopai.com/stream/pYrOAr1Rul2jDr~yBdH9C71Ky7VdzHT8~Gskrw__.mp4?yx=&refer=weibo_app&Expires=1528645062&ssig=LsePbMRafT&KID=unistore,video)

The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world. There are a number of habits that we need to move away from.

There are ***Seven deadly sins of speaking:*** Gossip, judging, negativity, complaining, excuses, lying and dogmatism. They are not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world and confusion the facts and opinions.

I'd like to suggest that four very powerful cornerstones and foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world.

Fortunately, these things spell a word: HAIL -- It has a great definition to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how our words will be received. 

- ***Honesty***: Be true in what you say, be clear and straight
- ***Authenticity***: Be yourself
- ***Integrity***: Be your word
- ***Love***: wish them will

Tempered with love, honesty is a great thing, and if you are really wishing somebody well, It's very hard to judge them at the same.

What would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously, and consuming sound consciously, and designing all our environments conscious for sound? That would be a world that dose sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the norm.
> 如果我们精心设计语言，用心感受语言，有意识地设计所有环境感知声音，这世界会变成什么样？那将是一个听起来很棒的世界，一个理解成为常态的世界。
