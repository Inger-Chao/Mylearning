## Time Management of Writing Material
	We don't build the lives we want by saving times, we build the lives we want, and then time saves itself.
	我们不通过积累时间构建我们的人生，我们随心所欲的对待我们的生活，然后说时间不够用。

***Ⅰ. Time is highly elastic.***

The speaker given an example that a very busy women takes 7 hours to resolve a problem to handle a broken water heater to show that time is highly elastic and we can take time to handle that matters.

>演讲人举了一个例子，一个非常忙碌的女性在一周花了七个小时去处理坏掉的热水器来说明时间有高弹性，我们可以挤出时间来处理重要的事情。

We can't make more time, but time will  stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.

> 我们不能创造出更多时间，但是时间可以延长以适应我们选择的投入。

The key to time management is treating out priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater.

> 时间管理的关键就是我们要对待优先级更高的事情像对待坏掉的热水器。

***Ⅱ. Time is a choice.***

There is a saying form a successful entrepreneur: "Everything I do, every minute I spend, It's my choice."

An interesting metaphor: I could tell you I don't have time to dust my blinds, but that's mot true. If you offered to pay me $100,000 to dust my blinds, I would get to it pretty quickly.

>一个有趣的比喻：我会告诉你我没时间为我的百叶窗除尘，但那并不是真的。如果你给我100,000美金让我去打扫我的窗户，我一定飞速去。

Granted, there may be horrible consequences for making different choices, but we are smart people and certainly over the long run, we have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there.

### How do we treat our priorities?

***Ⅰ. We need to figure out what they are.***

* **On professional side, Writer next year's review.** `What 3 to 5 things did you do that made it so amazing?` Pretending it's the end of next year, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and people you care about.
* **On family side, Write the family holiday letter.** `What 3 to 5 things would make it a greater year for you personally?` 

Between the performance review and the family holiday letter, we have a list of 6 to 10 goals we can work on this next year.

***Ⅱ. Break these down into doable steps and put them into our schedules first.***

A really good time to do this is Friday afternoons that economist calls a "low opportunity" time.

Take a little bit time of Friday afternoon, make yourself a three-category priority list:**career, relationships and self**.

***Ⅲ. There are 168 hours in a week and we can find time for what matters.***

If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week, sleeping 8 hours a night, so 50 hours to week, that leaves 72 hours for other things. <br>
A data example: There was once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks with time diaries and they found that people claiming  75-plus-hour work weeks were off by about 25 hours.<br>
We can find time for what matters to you but when most of us have bits of time, we pull out the phone, put around the house or watch TV.

***Ending:***
`"I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle."`Small moments can have great power. It's about looking at the whole of one's time and seeing where the stuff can go. I truly believe that There is time. Even if we are busy, we have time for what matters, and when we focus on what matters, we can built the lives we want in the time we're got.
