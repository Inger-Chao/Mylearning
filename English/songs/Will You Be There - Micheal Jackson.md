***以下为Michael 的独白 听的我心都扎烂了***
In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care
Will you be there
In my trials and my tribulations
through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence
In my turbulence
through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
for you're always
In my heart

>在我最昏暗的时光里
>最绝望的深渊里
>你还会在乎我吗
>你还会陪伴我吗
>在我的考验和苦难中
>会越过怀疑和废墟(寻找我)吗
>在暴力和动荡中
>会越过恐惧和忏悔(拥抱我)吗
>在我虚弱、满身伤痛的时候
>越过欢笑和悲伤(陪伴我)吗
>我承诺每一个明天
>永远不会让你孤单
>因为你永远
>在我心中
